# Gru

Gru is an open source adaptive test system for screening candidates for software engineering roles. It helps us identify and recruit the right minions.

To understand how Gru works, head over to our [Wiki](https://wiki.dgraph.io/Gru).

You can read more about why we built Gru on our [blog](https://open.dgraph.io/post/gru/). We are also planning to build a web frontend for Gru to make it more easy to use.
